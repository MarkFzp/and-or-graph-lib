# T_AOG Visualization Overview
**aogvisualizer** is an auxiliary component that utilizes Javascript along with D3 and DOT libraries to visualize any T_AOG object generated by [aog_lib](https://github.com/vcla/aog_lib).

# Code Overview
* `public/javascripts/visualizer.js` : takes JSON object and renders visualization along with D3.js
* `lib/dot/jgraph.js` : converts DOT object into JSON object
* `aog_examples` : consists of examples of graphs that can be visualized directly

# Usage
1. Construct a T_AOG object from [aog_lib](https://github.com/vcla/aog_lib)
2. Call `Visualize()`, which will output the following files
    * `graph.json` : a human readable format of the graph
    * `aog.txt` : the DOT format for visualization
3. Open the visualization webpage(index.html)
4. Click on "upload TXT file" and choose the `aog.txt` file

### About `graph.json`
* `"x" : [y, z]`: node x has two children y and z
* Example:
```
{
    "0" : [1, 2],
    "1" : [3, 4]
}
```

### About `aog.txt`
* `x -> y[weight="z"]`: an edge pointing from node x to node y with weight z
* `x[label="x", name="x", AO="O"]`: an Or-node with id x
* `y[label="y", name="y", AO="A"]`: an And-node with id y
* `z[label="z", name="z", AO="X"]`: an auxiliary root generated automatically when required
* Multi-edges are rendered as a single edge, but the weights can be viewed when hovering over the edge.
* Example:
```
digraph g{
    0 -> 1[weight="0.4"];
    0 -> 2[weight="0.6"];
    0[label="0", name="0", AO="O"];
    1[label="1", name="1", AO="A"];
    2[label="2", name="2", AO="A"];
}
```
